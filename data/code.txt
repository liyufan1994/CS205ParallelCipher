Dear brother,

Tonight, we will break out of jail. The time we do this will be midnight. Tony and his men will be ready outside. Inside, we have already had the jail guard Peter bought already. What we will do next is to basically get out of here at midnight and get out of state as soon as possible. You need to drive to Springfield big Dog's place to get us. Bring food and clean clothes and guns. Nobody should know this but we should be ready. Please come with your red Honda so that we can spot you in the dark.

Best luck,
The Don
